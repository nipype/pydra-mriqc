title: '{filename} :: Anatomical MRI report'
sections:
- name: Summary
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: summary, extension: [.html]}
- name: Basic visual report
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: background}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic enhancing the background around the head.
      Artifacts usually unveil themselves in the air surrounding the head, where no signal
      sources are present.
    subtitle: View of the background of the anatomical image
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: zoomed}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic of the brain. This mosaic is the most suitable to
      screen head-motion intensity inhomogeneities, global/local noise, signal leakage
      (for example, from the eyeballs and across the phase-encoding axis), etc.
    subtitle: Zoomed-in mosaic view of the brain
- name: Extended visual report
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: airmask}
    caption: The <em>hat</em>-mask calculated internally by MRIQC. Some metrics will use this
      mask, for instance, to find out artifacts and estimate the spread of gaussian noise
      added to the signal. This mask leaves out the air around the face to avoid measuring
      noise sourcing from the eyeballs and their movement.
    subtitle: '&laquo;Hat&raquo;-mask'
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: noisefit}
    caption: The noise fit internally estimated by MRIQC to calculate the QI<sub>1</sub> index
      proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21992" target="_blank">Mortamet et al. (2009)</a>.
    subtitle: Distribution of the noise within the <em>hat</em> mask
    style:
      max-width: 450px
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: artifacts}
    caption: Mask of artifactual intensities identified within the <em>hat</em>-mask.
    subtitle: Artifactual intensities on the background
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: brainmask}
    caption: Brain mask as internally extracted by MRIQC. Defects on the brainmask could
      indicate problematic aspects of the image quality-wise.
    subtitle: Brain extraction performance
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: head}
    caption: A mask of the head calculated internally by MRIQC.
    subtitle: Head mask
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: segmentation}
    caption: Brain tissue segmentation, as internally extracted by MRIQC.
      Defects on this segmentation, as well as noisy tissue labels could
      indicate problematic aspects of the image quality-wise.
    subtitle: Brain tissue segmentation
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: norm}
    caption: This panel shows a <em>quick-and-dirty</em> nonlinear registration into
      the <code>MNI152NLin2009cAsym</code> template accessed with
      <a href="https://templateflow.org/browse" target="_blank"><em>TemplateFlow</em></a>.
    subtitle: Spatial normalization of the anatomical image

    captions: <em>MRIQC</em> may have recorded failure conditions.

    settings:
      # By default, only the first dictionary will be expanded.
      # If folded is true, all will be folded. If false all expanded.
      folded: true

      Thanks for using <em>MRIQC</em>. The following information may assist in
      reconstructing the provenance of the corresponding derivatives.
