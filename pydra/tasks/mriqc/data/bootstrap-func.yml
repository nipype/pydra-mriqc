packagename: mriqc
title: "{filename} :: MRIQC's BOLD fMRI report"
sections:
- name: Summary
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: summary, extension: [.html]}
- name: Basic echo-wise reports
  ordering: echo
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: stdev}
    subtitle: Standard deviation of signal through time
    caption: The voxel-wise standard deviation of the signal (variability along time).
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: background}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic enhancing the background around the head.
      Artifacts usually unveil themselves in the air surrounding the head, where no signal
      sources are present.
    subtitle: View of the background of the voxel-wise average of the BOLD timeseries
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: zoomed}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic of the brain. This mosaic is the most suitable to
      screen head-motion intensity inhomogeneities, global/local noise, signal leakage
      (for example, from the eyeballs and across the phase-encoding axis), etc.
    subtitle: Voxel-wise average of BOLD time-series, zoomed-in covering just the brain
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: carpet}
    subtitle: Carpetplot and nuisance signals
    caption: The so-called &laquo;carpetplot&raquo; may assist in assessing head-motion
      derived artifacts and respiation effects.

- name: Extended echo-wise reports
  ordering: echo
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: mean}
    subtitle: Voxel-wise average of BOLD time-series
    caption: The average signal calculated across the last axis (time).

- name: Extended reports shared across echos
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: brainmask}
    caption: Brain mask as internally extracted by MRIQC. Defects on the brainmask could
      indicate problematic aspects of the image quality-wise.
    subtitle: Brain extraction performance
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: norm}
    caption: This panel shows a <em>quick-and-dirty</em> nonlinear registration into
      the <code>MNI152NLin2009cAsym</code> template accessed with
      <a href="https://templateflow.org/browse" target="_blank"><em>TemplateFlow</em></a>.
    subtitle: Spatial normalization of the anatomical image
    static: false

- name: About
  nested: true
  reportlets:
  - custom: errors
    path: '{reportlets_dir}/{run_uuid}'
    captions: <em>MRIQC</em> may have recorded failure conditions.
    title: Errors
  - metadata: "input"
    settings:
      # By default, only the first dictionary will be expanded.
      # If folded is true, all will be folded. If false all expanded.
      folded: true
      # If an ID is not provided, one should be generated automatically
      id: 'about-metadata'

      Thanks for using <em>MRIQC</em>. The following information may assist in
      reconstructing the provenance of the corresponding derivatives.
